## Mansion Explorer

Mansion Explorer is a 2D tile-based game designed to explore computational graphics concepts such as rasterisation, shadows, texture mapping, etc. The game provides an immersive experience where players navigate through dark rooms in a mansion using a torch to find hidden items.

**(a) Objectives:**

- Implement rasterisation techniques to render the mansion and its rooms.
- Utilise shadow algorithms to create immersive darkness and lighting effects.
- Apply texture mapping to enhance the visual appeal of the mansion and its surroundings.
- Develop interactive gameplay mechanics that utilize the player's torch to reveal items.

**(b) Methodology:**

- *Rasterisation*: Utilise rasterisation techniques to render the mansion, rooms, and interactive elements within the game world. Implement efficient algorithms to handle tile-based rendering for optimal performance.
- *Shadows*: Implement shadow algorithms such as shadow mapping to simulate realistic lighting and shadows within the mansion.
- *Texture Mapping*: Apply texture mapping to surfaces within the mansion to add detail to the environment. Experiment with different textures to create visually appealing scenes.
