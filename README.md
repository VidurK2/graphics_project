## 1. Gravity Simulator

The proposed project aims to develop an engaging particle simulator application, offering users the ability to create and manipulate particles with customizable attributes. Users will have control over various effects such as gravity,  motion, collision, and possibly time.

**(a) Objectives:**

- Create an intuitive user interface allowing users to add particles with customizable sizes.
- Implement functionalities to control effects like gravity, motion, collision.
- Provide options for users to enable/disable collisions and add various objects for particles to interact with.

**(b) Methodology:**

- **User Interface Development:** Design a user-friendly interface enabling users to add particles and adjust their attributes.
  
- **Particle Dynamics Implementation:** Implement algorithms for simulating particle behavior, including gravitational, motion, collision, etc.
  
- **Simulation Controls:** Develop controls for users to toggle the above effects.

## 2. Voronoi Diagrams

The proposed project aims to leverage Voronoi Diagrams to develop two interactive features. Firstly, users will be able to plot points to create appropriate regions around them and understand what voronoi diagrams are. Secondly, the project will utilize Voronoi Diagrams to strategically position fielders in a cricket match. These features will facilitate user interaction with Voronoi Diagrams and aid in planning out player positioning in cricket matches, enhancing both fielding and batting strategies.

**(a) Objectives:**

- Develop an interactive platform allowing users to plot points and generate Voronoi Diagrams around them.
- Implement the same to identify strategic fielding locations based on Voronoi Diagrams in a cricket field.
- Provide insights for fielding teams to optimize player positioning and for batting teams to identify potential weaknesses in the fielding setup.
- Enhance user understanding and engagement with Voronoi Diagrams through practical applications in cricket.

**(b). Methodology:**

- **Interactive Voronoi Diagram Generation:** Develop a user-friendly interface where users can input points and visualize the corresponding Voronoi Diagram. This will involve implementing algorithms for Voronoi Diagram construction and integrating them into the platform.

- **Strategic Fielding Positioning:** Utilize Voronoi Diagrams to determine optimal fielding positions for cricket fielders.
