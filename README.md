## 1. Gravity Simulator

The proposed project aims to develop an engaging particle simulator application, offering users the ability to create and manipulate particles with customizable attributes. Users will have control over various effects such as gravity,  motion, collision, and possibly time.

**(a) Objectives:**

- Create an intuitive user interface allowing users to add particles with customizable sizes.
- Implement functionalities to control effects like gravity, motion, collision.
- Provide options for users to enable/disable collisions and add various objects for particles to interact with.

- Collision Detection: Implement efficient algorithms, such as bounding box collision detection, to accurately detect collisions between particles and objects in the simulation.
- Rendering Optimization: Introduce rendering optimizations, such as batch rendering and object pooling, to enhance performance and maintain a smooth frame rate, even with a large number of particles

Furthermore, I intend to extend the project by incorporating one or more specific enhancements, such as Particle Effects (such as trails), Dynamic Lighting to simulate light sources and object shadows, environment mapping, or potentially real-time ray tracing. I will research these concepts thoroughly and including at least one of them, if not more, on top of the project to enrich the simulation.

**(b) Methodology:**

- **User Interface Development:** Design a user-friendly interface enabling users to add particles and adjust their attributes.
  
- **Particle Dynamics Implementation:** Implement algorithms for simulating particle behavior, including gravitational, motion, collision, etc.
  
- **Simulation Controls:** Develop controls for users to toggle the above effects.
